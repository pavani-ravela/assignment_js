                    <h3>Painting</h3>
                    <p>I engaged myself to designing, drawing of portraits, mural painting, and a lot more. Although this just a hobby to some, engaging myself to art is beneficial for me. In times when I experience anxiety and depression, painting allowed me to understand myself more. I tend to ask myself and examine about what went wrong, what did I do wrong, and whether or not I responded ethically and morally. It was as if the paint brush allowed me to dive to my inner being. Every stroke that I make, the level of my anxiety decreases.</p>

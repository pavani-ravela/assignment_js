        <p>
            I'm Alex, a third-year law student at City University. I'd say I'm someone who's not just comfortable in high-pressure environments, but also adept at handling confrontational situations and tough conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, I've worked part-time at a local law firm as a legal assistant. This position frequently involved making difficult phone calls to clients or delivering news that wasn't always positive. These conversations taught me the importance of clear, compassionate communication, even when the message was tough.

            I'm excited to apply these abilities to a law internship, where dealing with complex client interactions and high-pressure scenarios is part of the job.

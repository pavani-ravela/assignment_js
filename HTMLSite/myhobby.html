            <h3>Painting</h3>
            <p>I engaged myself to designing, drawing of portraits, mural painting, and a lot more. Although this just a hobby to some, engaging myself to art is beneficial for me. In times when I experience anxiety and depression, painting allowed me to understand myself more. I tend to ask myself and examine about what went wrong, what did I do wrong, and whether or not I responded ethically and morally. It was as if the paint brush allowed me to dive to my inner being. Every stroke that I make, the level of my anxiety decreases.</p>

            <p>Gardening is a great pleasure, it gives me peace of mind and satisfaction. It is also a great source of recreation. I enjoy gardening because it makes me happy, creative, and cheerful. If you believe it or not gardening helps to create a healthier environment.

                Different people choose different hobbies according to their tastes. Gardening is a physical activity, also a hobby, which improves my health and strength, helps me relax and reduces my stress levels. Gardening is a hobby that is suitable for all weather, men, women, children, young or old. My small garden is blessed with a variety of flowers and leaves.</p>

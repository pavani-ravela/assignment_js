    <h3>Hyderabad</h3>
    <p>The grand city of Hyderabad in the Deccan South of India, happens to not only be my birthplace, but also a significant hi-tech area in the country today. However, as history reveals, Hyderabad is well known for its unique culture, language, food, clothing etc. The Hyderabadi culture comes way back from the time the Mughal Emperors ruled India; starting from the QutubShahi kings to the last of Nizam dynasty of Hyderabad.
    There are two main languages spoken in Hyderabad: Urdu and Telugu. Telugu is spoken by the people of Andhra Pradesh (the state of which Hyderabad is the capital) and Urdu is spoken in its unique Hyderabadi style. This Urdu is not exactly coherent with the Urdu spoken in Lucknow (where the language originated)in North India. The Hyderabadi Urdu (or 'Deccani' as it is sometimes referred)has a touch of words from Telugu, Marathi and a few others. Still, this language is popularly referred as 'sweet and romantic' and I sure am proud of my mother tongue
    Here are some pictures of the Royal City:</p>
